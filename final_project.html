<h1>How to Play War</h1>
<p>Once the game loads to start the game press Start Game button. This will take you to the instructions screen that explains how the game works,
    once read you can press the Join Game button to join! Once joined the flip button will appear, press it to flip cards to beat the computer.
    Once you are out of cards the flip button will automatically disappear and the shuffle cards button will appear. Once the shuffle button is
    pressed then the flip card will return. Once there is a tie the flip button will disappear and the flip war cards button will appear. Once
    clicked four more cards will be placed, or as many as you have to go to WAR and break the tie. If there is a tie once again there will be as
    random winner, then the flip button will appear again. This will keep happening until one player has all the cards then that player wins!</p>
