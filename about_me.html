		<p>My name is Ronnie Williams, my birthday is April 8th, 2001. I lived in Cranston until I was 8, then moved to Coventry and started
			first grade. I graduated from Coventry High School in 2019 and now majoring in Accounting in the class of 2023. I am the
			Assistant Manager at Auntie Anne's in the Warwick Mall and a Shift Leader at Dunkin' in Coventry. After working for four years I
			saved enough money and recently I purchased a 2020 Jeep Grand Cherokee, this is one of my dream cars. I plan on having this car
			till the end of its life then upgrading to a Tesla model X, my other dream car. When I graduate college I plan on opening a
			restaurant with my close friend. As you can tell I like working in the food industry why would I major in Accounting? My future
			plan is to own a few businesses and do all the accounting work which is something I love and at the same time I can also work in
			a restaurant which I also love. As working as management roles for the past four years I've learned a lot of good things to do
			and a lot of bad things not to do. I plan on using my findings of how to be a good management role model in the future when I
			have a business of my own!</p>

				<p>I look forward to this every year and this is a picture of my close friends annual midnight Black Friday shift. I go in
					at 9:00 pm on Thanksgiving to start open the store and mark up all our prices, we change our prices on this night
					because it starts the busy season in the mall with Christmas coming and minimum wage usually goes up two months
					after.</p>
